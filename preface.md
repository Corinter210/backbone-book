# Preface

Not long ago I decided I'd run a project in parallel with [Lisant]()https://lisant.io), and I called it "A treatise on Backbone.js".

But you know what, it's literature like that that's part of the problem that's pervasive with the entire ecosystem of JS apps (be it Ember, Angular, or whatever else). They're lengthy, tiresome, and for every one valuable piece of info, they give you 4 others that you won't care until you're somewhat serious into it.

So this is me untangling myself from my own bullshit. And this here is aimed at people still making decisions regarding pure front-end client stacks, as well as being a good link to send around to your friends who may be already into it but are tangled in *their* own bullshit believing there is such a thing as a framework to own them all.

The whole thing is one huge list. I don't care if lists are popular. That's not why I'm formatting it as such. I'm doing that because it's the best way for me to tell you what to do, and for you to get it done today, or tomorrow tops.

And when you're better than me, and you don't have to listen to my opinion anymore, you can then correct me on Twitter, and be all ranty and stuff too.
